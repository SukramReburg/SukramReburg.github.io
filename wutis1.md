          The algorithmic trading division approaches financial markets in a rule based,
          quantitative environment making use of statistics and various machine learning concepts.
          The team codifies heuristics from asset selection, to position sizes and other investment criteria.

          After making it through our assessment center, members contribute along the whole value chain
          of algorithmic trading starting from idea generation to the final implementation of algorithms,
          by performing research, designing prototypes, implementing analytics and trading algorithms
          in order to manage alpha and risk inventory.
