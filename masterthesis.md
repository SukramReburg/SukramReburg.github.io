    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>
      Credit risk assessment remains a fundamental aspect of financial stability, with institutions relying on robust models to effectively estimate borrower reliability and minimize default risks.
      Despite their foundational status, traditional statistical methods, such as logistic regression and discriminant analysis, are increasingly challenged by the complexities of financial data.
      This thesis focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms, with an emphasis on Random Forests, to enhance credit risk modeling.
      Random Forests offer several advantages, including the capacity to process high-dimensional, collinear data and to withstand the effects of imbalanced datasets.
      This thesis discusses methodologies to enhance the predictive accuracy and interpretability of Random Forests, including data sampling techniques, feature selection methods, and modifications of the voting process.
      These strategies are evaluated within the context of credit risk, addressing both the technical challenges of model construction and the regulatory demands for explainable decision-making processes.
