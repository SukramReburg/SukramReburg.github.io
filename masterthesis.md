**Summary:** Credit risk assessment remains a fundamental aspect of financial stability, with institutions relying on robust models to effectively estimate borrower reliability and minimize
default risks. Despite their foundational status, traditional statistical methods, such as logistic regression and discriminant analysis, are increasingly challenged by the complexities
of financial data. This thesis focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms,
with an emphasis on Random Forests, to enhance credit risk modeling. Random Forests
offer several advantages, including the capacity to process high-dimensional, collinear
data and to withstand the effects of imbalanced datasets. This thesis will discuss various
methodologies to enhance the predictive accuracy and interpretability of Random Forests.
These include data sampling techniques, feature selection methods and the modification
of the voting process of the Random Forest. These strategies are evaluated within the
context of credit risk, addressing both the technical challenges of model construction and
the regulatory demands for explainable decision-making processes.
