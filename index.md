        I work at the overlap of statistical rigor, practical machine learning, and real-world risk constraints,
        translating methods into decisions that are robust, transparent, and implementable.

### Who I am
I pursued a masters degree in Statistics and Mathematics in Economics at TU Wien, with a particular emphasis on quantitative methods and data-driven decision-making. My personal interests lie at the intersection of predictive modeling and cutting-edge statistical approaches, particularly when theory collides with the real world. 
In my master’s thesis, I explored the pracitcal boundaries of the random forest model, developing new methodological approaches and applying concepts from other areas to enhance it. 
In my current position as Quantitative Analyst, I concentrate on credit risk management, applying statistical techniques to — and sometimes beyond — regulatory limitations in a meaningful way.

As part of WUTIS Algorithmic Trading Division, I investigate algorithmic trading concepts, develop and test systematic trading approaches, and implement them fully, from data processing to execution logic, in R and Python. Driven by innovation and the constant motivation to learn and improve I am more concerned with whether something actually works rather than how well it sounds.
